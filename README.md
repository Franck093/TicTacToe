## Technologies

I coded this project with ReactJS.

The Tic Tac Toe game is a popular project to start with ReactJS. Here, I chose to code my project by only making use of function components.

This project was created through [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](Create-React-App).

## Design

I was inspired by the design of the video game Hotline Miami to create this retro design.
